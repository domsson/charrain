This is a pretty lame attempt at implementing a "code rain" screen as seen in the movie "The Matrix". Lame, because the idea was to sacrifice portability and configurability in exchange for better performance and visuals compared to the existing `cmatrix`. However, while I _did_ manage to improve the visuals _somewhat_, I also ended up with noticeably _worse_ performance. Not only that, but while this looks great in (u)rxvt, it kind of flickers in pretty much every other terminal I've testet it in. Oh well, I've tried.
